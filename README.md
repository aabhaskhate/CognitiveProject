# ASTRA - Advanced System for Transaction Risk Analysis

## üö® Introduction
With the increasing adoption of digital payments, online fraud has become a significant concern. Traditional methods of fraud detection often fail to identify sophisticated fraudulent activities. 

**ASTRA** is an advanced fraud detection system designed to predict fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and speed by analyzing various customer and transaction-related parameters.

## üéØ Objective
To build a robust and scalable model that detects fraudulent transactions in real-time with high accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python 3.11** for data processing and model implementation
- **Pandas** for data cleaning and manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation
- **Joblib** for model saving and loading
- **Streamlit** for building the interactive web application

## üîç Data Preprocessing Techniques Applied
‚úÖ **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values were filled using mean, median, or mode depending on the data type.  
‚úÖ **Encoding Categorical Variables:** The `LabelEncoder()` from `sklearn.preprocessing` was applied to convert categorical data into numerical format.  
‚úÖ **Feature Engineering:**
- `Time_of_Day` was derived from `Transaction_Date` to capture transaction patterns.
- `Transaction_Amount` was normalized to improve model convergence.

---

## üöÄ Model Selection and Implementation
### **Chosen Model:** Random Forest Classifier
**Reason for Selection:**
- Handles both categorical and numerical data efficiently
- Provides excellent performance on tabular data
- Reduces overfitting with ensemble learning

### **Steps Implemented:**
1. Data split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
2. Random Forest model trained with optimized hyperparameters.
3. Model evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Predictions displayed with fraud indicators.

## üìà Results and Insights
**Performance Metrics:**
- **Accuracy:** 94.5%
- **Precision:** 92%
- **Recall:** 89%
- **F1-Score:** 90.5%

**Insights:**
- High transaction amounts at odd hours showed higher fraud tendencies.
- Fraudulent activities often occurred in crowded metro cities with a higher density of ATMs.
- Transactions with unknown devices posed a higher fraud risk.

## üí° Solutions and Recommendations
‚úÖ Real-time alerts for suspicious transactions exceeding a predefined threshold.  
‚úÖ Implement dynamic spending limits based on customer behavior.  
‚úÖ Develop a user-specific risk profile using behavioral analytics.
